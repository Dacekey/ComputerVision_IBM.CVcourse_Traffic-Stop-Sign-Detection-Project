Module Summary: Object Detection
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: 

Object detection goes beyond classification by locating multiple objects in an image, assigning each a class and a bounding box.

The sliding window algorithm systematically scans sub-images, classifying each region. Challenges include overlapping detections, varying object sizes, and shapes.

Bounding boxes define object locations with coordinates (either corner points or width/height), and object detection aims to predict these coordinates along with the class.

The bounding box pipeline trains a model using both class labels and bounding box coordinates, producing predictions with updated parameters for object detection.

Detection models also output a confidence score (0 to 1); applying a threshold ensures only reliable predictions are kept, improving accuracy. Setting a high score threshold reduces false detections and improves the identification of correct objects in an image.

Haar feature-based cascade classifiers, proposed by Viola and Jones in 2001, are used for object detection tasks like cars, traffic lights, and pedestrians.

The method trains on large sets of positive images (with the object) and negative images (background), extracting features using Haar wavelets.

Haar wavelets detect edges, lines, and diagonal edges, and the integral image technique speeds up feature calculation by summing pixel regions efficiently.

A 24×24 window produces over 180,000 features, but AdaBoost reduces this to about 6,000 by selecting only the most important features.

AdaBoost combines weak classifiers into a strong classifier, emphasizing misclassified examples in each round to improve accuracy.

Cascade classifiers apply detection in multiple stages, quickly discarding regions without the object and passing only likely candidates to deeper stages for verification.
