    "You've learned to train and apply custom image classifiers in this course. In the final project, you'll practice applying skills to create a custom classifier that identifies **traffic signs** i.e., whether or not an image contains a **stop sign**. Practical machine learning skills are highlighted in this project: **image data processing, feature extraction, model training, and model accuracy assessment**. The objective is to develop an accurate image classifier based on the given dataset to **recognize stop signs**.\n",

    "## **II./ Project Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have just been recruited as a Junior Data Scientist at Jokwu, a self-driving car company based in Cape Town, South Africa. The firm has created the hardware components of the vehicle and is currently developing vision-based systems to recognize road signs. As part of this work, you have been instructed to develop a model to recognize stop signs in photographs. You will use a JupyterLab-based environment in the Final assignment: **Building an Image Classifier with Transfer Learning** to train and build the model. The model will be a foundation for subsequent safety and motion control features. Your assignment is to train and evaluate a model that predicts whether an image includes a stop sign using a labeled dataset, your team has provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you complete your assignment, please download the completed notebook and take the required screenshots of your work. You can then submit your project using one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1 – AI-Graded Submission:\n",
    "Upload the downloaded notebook directly for AI-based evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2 – Peer-Reviewed Submission:\n",
    "Submit the screenshots you captured as evidence of your completed work for peer evaluation."
