    "You have completed a series of labs exploring the core concepts of computer vision and image processing through hands-on exercises in Jupyter Notebooks. Each lab guided you through key tasks such as loading and visualizing images, applying transformations, building simple classifiers, and understanding how neural networks interpret visual data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Option 1: AI-Graded Submission and Evaluation**\n",
    "  - Complete all the exercises in the notebook.\n",
    "  - After finishing, save and download your Jupyter Notebook file.\n",
    "  - Submit the downloaded file for AI-based evaluation.\n",
    "  - Once submitted, you will receive automated grades instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Option 2: Peer-Graded Submission and Evaluation**\n",
    "  - Complete all exercises in the notebook.\n",
    "  - Take screenshots of each completed exercise as instructed throughout the assignment.\n",
    "    + Each screenshot should include your code and output (or markdown, as specified).\n",
    "    + Screenshots can be saved in .png or .jpg format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this option, you will receive your grades based on the evaluation from other peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using **Option 1 for faster grading**. However, if you experience difficulties with this method or cannot access it, you may choose Option 2 instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You are required to choose only one submission option — either AI-Graded or Peer-Graded, and not both, to receive grades for the final assignment."
