    "You’ll build an effective image classifier using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet). In practice, very few people train an entire ConvNet from scratch with random initialization, as this requires a very large labeled dataset and significant computational resources. Instead, it is common to use a ConvNet that has been pretrained on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) by others, and adapt it for a specific task—a process known as transfer learning.\n",
    "Here, we’ll use the pretrained network as a feature extractor by training only the final output layer on your dataset. Typically, 100–200 images are enough to get started, and training can be completed in a short amount of time. While adding more images can improve performance, the gains often diminish as the dataset grows.\n"
