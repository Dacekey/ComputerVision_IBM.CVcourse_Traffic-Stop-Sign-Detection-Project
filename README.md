This is a foundation knowledge about Computer Vision for beginner. This course is published by IBM on Coursera. I have already learned and package it into Notebooks. The course named "Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing".

There is 4 main files:
  1. Labs: where contains the practice notebooks.
  2. Lessons: where contains the theory notebooks.
  3. FinalProject: where applying all knowledge to build a model that detect 'stop-sign' in term of traffic.
  4. FinalQuiz: some small questions to summarise the total course.

I recommend watching and reviewing the file 'Lessons' first, then coming into file 'Labs' to review more.
