# Overview
This repository provides foundational knowledge in Computer Vision for beginners. The content is based on the IBM Coursera course "Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing". The materials have been systematically studied, organized, and repackaged into structured Jupyter Notebooks for ease of learning and practical implementation.

# Repository Structure
The project consists of four main components:
  1. Labs – Contains practical notebooks for hands-on implementation and experimentation.
  2. Lessons – Includes theoretical notebooks covering fundamental concepts.
  3. FinalProject – Applies the acquired knowledge to develop a model for detecting traffic stop signs.
  4. FinalQuiz – Provides review questions to summarize and reinforce the course content.
It is recommended to study the Lessons first to build a theoretical foundation, and then proceed to the Labs for practical reinforcement.

# Requirements and Tools
**1. Programming Language and Libraries**
* OpenCV, Pillow – Image processing
* NumPy – Numerical computation for image data
* Matplotlib – Data visualization and plotting

**2. Linear Algebra**
Fundamental knowledge of linear algebra is required for understanding image transformations and model construction.

**3. Jupyter Lab**
Used as the primary development and experimentation environment.
